Abstract Clock Assignment 

Your goal is to build a creative interpretation of the clock, focused on aesthetics and inventiveness, and make it accessible via a url. For example: 1, 2, 3. Your interpretation needs to be legible enough that your reader can visually distinguish which is the hour, the minute, vs. the second; otherwise your reader should be able to guess the time within a quarter-hour of accuracy. When choosing your design, consider the different states of the clock at different moments in time, e.g. when values are near max or min. Every time the minute changes (not more frequently), print the value of minute() to the JavaScript console.
